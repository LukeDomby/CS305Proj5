## Imaginary Project

So this project will redifine what it means to be revolutionary as it revolutionizes the idea of projects.
It will completely flip the paradigm of marking giberish for projects that never really result in anything.
This project will completely redefine what it is to completely make things up as you talk to really get people invested.

## Imaginary Module

1 credit classes suck because you end up spending more time than you should on the assignments. Also, the instructions need to be better for the coming semesters.

### License 

This would probably use the MIT licnese, idk
